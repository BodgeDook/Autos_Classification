The description:

'have finally built my first neural_network that can figure out the car's brand name (at least, 'hope so).
'donwloded scikit-learn lib to use KNeighborsClassification algorithm to teach my n-n.
In nearest future, I'll make it look more professional and usable (I'll also may add some more brands if 'found more cars datsets).

And also, I'll leave here my cars dataset so anyone would be able to use it or to find some information they need.
