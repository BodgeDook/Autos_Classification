The description:

'have finally built my first neural_network that can figure out the car's brand name (at least, 'hope so).
'donwloded scikit-learn lib to use KNeighborsClassification algorithm to teach my n-n (neural network).
In nearest future, I'll make it look more professional and usable (I'll also may add some more brands if 'found more cars datsets).

And also, I'll leave here my cars dataset so anyone would be able to use it or to find some information they need.

Also, some notes about used libraries:
  1) To read the excel-data you need to import the 'openpyxl' lib, so pandas would be able to read the 'datasets' like mine.
  2) Another note is about scikit-learn: 'used scale and KNeighborsClassifier to learn the n-n (scale is used to
  generalise all values to a common 'mashstab' or a value).
  3) Also, 'used one-hot-encoding to encode the string parts of the data into the numbers. It belongs to the pandas lib and looks like: 'pd.get_dummies(...)'.
     'can say that this funtion already exists in a pandas lib, so you don't need to donwload any other libs like openpyxl.

LITTLE_REMARK: instead of 'I', I use the " ' " - apotstroph: instead of writing "I'll explain that part of a code", I'd write: "'ll explain that part of a code".
Say what you want, but 'just like that type of 'I' - wirinting, so, please, do not wonder about it:)
